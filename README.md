# SingularisArt prompt

![main](images/1.png)

Visible here are:

- Concise left-hand prompt consisting of:
  - Last component of current directory (abbreviates $HOME to ~ if possible).
  - Prompt marker, ‚ùØ, the
    ["HEAVY RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE QUOTATION MARK ORNAMENT"](https://codepoints.net/U+276F)
    (that's `\u276f`, or `e2 9d af` in UTF-8).
- Extended right-hand size prompt which auto-hides when necessary to make room
  for long commands and contains:
  - Duration of previous command in adaptive units (seconds, minutes, hours,
    days, depending on duration).
  - Current version control branch name.
  - Current version control worktree status using colors that match those used
    in `git status`:
    - Green dot indicates staged changes.
    - Red dot indicates unstaged changes.
    - Blue dot indicates untracked files.
  - Full version of current working directory (again, abbreviating `$HOME` to
    `~`).
